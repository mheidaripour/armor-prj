# Naming Contracts

## Variable Names

Please use **Camel Case** to name the variables. Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter.

## Funtion Names

Please use **Snake Case** for function names. Each word is separated by an underscore character.

## Class Names

Please use **Pascal Case** for class names. Each word starts with a capital letter.

# Git contracts

Please only work on the `develop` branch. Upon review and testing, it will be merged into the `main` branch. Please refrain from pushing to the main branch.

Please add your `temporary files` and the files that you are not going to push to the project repository to the end of the `.gitignore` file.

# Documentation

Please provide sufficient commenting for all functions, classes, and variables to ensure their understandability for any reader of the code. Additionally, if you are writing code that includes numerous classes, functions, and any type of relationships between classes (e.g., delegation or inheritance), please prepare class diagrams to visualize the relationships.

# conf.yaml
You can define global constants or the other project properties in key-value format in the conf.yaml file, then use this conf.yaml anywhere in the project.
